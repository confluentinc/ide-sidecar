/**
 * An interface that defines the test methods for a suite of functional tests to be run against
 * the <i>current test environment</i> and a <i>current connection</i> in the running
 * sidecar instance.
 *
 * <p>The {@link SidecarClientApi} provides the basic methods to interact with the sidecar REST API.
 * The {@link #environment()} method provides access to the current test environment, which can be
 * used to directly access the Kafka cluster, Schema Registry, and any other resources in the system
 * under test.
 *
 * <p>Integration tests will define subclasses of {@link AbstractIT} that implement one or more
 * interfaces that extend this {@link ITSuite} interface, to run those tests against the
 * the {@link TestEnvironment} and one or more connections. These classes will implement the
 * {@link #environment()} method and will implement thee {@link #setupConnection()} method to
 * set up the current connection to be used by all test methods in the suite.
 * The {@link #setupConnection()} implementation can use the various methods on
 * {@link TestEnvironment}, like {@link TestEnvironment#localConnectionSpec()} or
 * {@link TestEnvironment#directConnectionSpec(boolean)}, that return
 * {@link io.confluent.idesidecar.restapi.models.ConnectionSpec} instances that can then be used to
 * {@link #createConnection(ConnectionSpec) create connections in the sidecar}.
