/**
 * Definition of <a href="https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi#events-and-observers">CDI event</a>
 * and utilities. Quarkus CDI events is built on top of
 * <a href="https://docs.jboss.org/weld/reference/latest/en-US/html/events.html">Weld events</a>
 * (more in depth documentation).
 *
 * <h2>Producers and Consumers</h2>
 *
 * <p>Event <i>producers</i> fire events using the {@link Event} channel mechanism, which are
 * {@link jakarta.inject.Inject @Inject}-ed into the bean that is producing events.
 * The type of {@link Event} channel dictates the kind of events that can be emitted.
 *
 * <p>Event <i>consumers</i> use the {@link jakarta.enterprise.event.Observes} annotation on methods
 * that are to consume events fired by producers. Each consumer method handles a specific kind of
 * event.
 *
 * <p>This event mechanism decouples producers and consumers: a producer can emit events without
 * regard for which if any components will consume them, while consumers can consume events without
 * regard for the components that are producing the events.
 *
 * <h2>Qualifiers</h2>
 *
 * <p>Qualifiers are annotations that can be emitted with each event to add information about the
 * event. Qualifiers can represent any information, and are independent of the event type.
 * But typically qualifiers augment the event with additional information useful to consumers.
 *
 * <h3>Reusable Qualifiers</h3>
 * This package defines several qualifiers that can be reused on different event types.
 *
 * <p>The {@link Lifecycle} qualifiers represent different states within an
 * objects lifecycle, though not all these qualifiers may apply to states in the
 * lifecycle of an object:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link Lifecycle.Created}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Lifecycle.Updated}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Lifecycle.Connected}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Lifecycle.Disconnected}</li>
 *   <li>{@link Lifecycle.Deleted}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link ServiceKind} qualifiers represent different types of connections:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ServiceKind.CCloud}</li>
 *   <li>{@link ServiceKind.ConfluentPlatform}</li>
 *   <li>{@link ServiceKind.Local}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link ClusterKind} qualifiers represent different types of clusters:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link ClusterKind.Kafka}</li>
 *   <li>{@link ClusterKind.SchemaRegistry}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Other qualifiers can be added.
 *
 * <h3>Consumers and Qualifiers</h3>
 *
 * <p>Consumers can also optionally use qualifiers to filter the kinds of events they want to see.
 *
 * <p>A consumer method that does not include any qualifiers will receive all events.
 * Typically, consumer methods use either no qualifiers (receive all events) or
 * a single qualifier to receive events with that qualifier.
 *
 * <p>It is possible for a consumer method to use multiple qualifiers, but the method is called
 * if its set of qualifiers is a subset of the fired event's qualifiers -- in other words,
 * all method qualifiers exist on the event. This is likely useful when the qualifiers
 * are orthogonal (e.g., one lifecycle qualifiers and another connection type qualifier).
